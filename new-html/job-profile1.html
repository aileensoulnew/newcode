						<p>To get started, you first need to create a master profile on the platform. Aileensoul’s registration process is quite simple and straight-forward and requires bare minimum details to grant you access to the site’s contents. Once you have successfully registered yourself with the platform, you will be able to view its five profiles, namely ‘Business’, ‘Job’, ‘Recruiter’, ‘Artistic’ and ‘Freelance’. Because each of them serves a distinct purpose, hence you need to create individual sub-profiles to seek advantage of their varied offerings. 
						In order to list your profile under the ‘Job’ category, click on the visible ‘Register’ button which will redirect you to the next page where you will be asked to provide mandatory details about yourself, such as your name, email address, date of birth, languages known etc. Once you have populated your basic information, you will be prompted to list your educational qualifications, project and training/internship details as well as information specific to your work area and work experience (you can choose to skip this section or mark yourself as a ‘fresher’ if you are yet to launch your career). 
						Even though the site will let you skip quite a few of these sections if you do not wish to populate every field, it is in your own interest that you devote some time to complete this one-time activity (unless you need to modify your details at a later stage) with thoroughness and accuracy. This is because your profile stands a greater chance of grabbing a recruiter’s attention if you are able to elaborate the key highlights of the project that you have accomplished in a comprehensive and attractive manner and/or if you can successfully emphasise your unique skills using specific keywords and industry-specific terminologies that truly demonstrate your skills and that are frequently looked up by companies and recruiters during their search for candidates with matching skill sets. 
						Once you have filled all the important job-related details, click on ‘Submit’ to finish the registration process of your ‘Job Profile’. Next time that you log in to Aileensoul, you will see an active ‘Take me in’ button against this service profile. Tap this button to kick-start the process of job hunting and browse through the recommended job list to shortlist and apply to roles that best complement your skills, experience, interests and salary expectations.
